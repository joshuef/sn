### Refactor

 - <csr-id-6ba7b5a12ed8d15fb807524ee90dc250068c1004/> removing Comm::members and unnecessary private types
   - We now use Comm::sessions as the list of members we keep sessions with,
   which is updated only when the user wants to update the set of known peers.
   - Removing unnecessary PeerSession's SessionStatus, disconnect fn, and SessionCmd.
   - Never remove sessions from Comm::sessions unless the set of known members is
   updated/changed by the user. Even if we failed to send using all peer session's connections,
   we keep the session since it's been set as a known and connectable peer.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-b6ee82b6f5abf129e3e0d84e60e15272479e0db2/> remove ConnectionEvents and listener
   They are no longer needed.
   Instead we listen to incoming msgs only, but do not keep
   any incoming connections at all. So nothing to clean up
   there now.
 - <csr-id-61d2bc2d35e3f829d58af736a722d01cd86864b6/> only cache connections created by us
 - <csr-id-783d62461a65eb7c06b0d4f399b97216b6c75519/> sn_interface-0.16.14/sn_client-0.77.8/sn_node-0.72.25/sn_api-0.75.4/sn_cli-0.68.5

 - <csr-id-dbfa4ac0dd23e76060b8df44c4666a30bb9b317f/> replace node comms with sn_comms
 - <csr-id-a86d5ad1f352c9000488197ece8edb716941d601/> make a new crate for comm

### Chore

 - <csr-id-12a6620525a5767d906037a74caf0e38af3da596/> rename update_members to update_valid_comm_targets for clarity

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b5e57d5b3d91849074a90f5ba671d9b19b7e4461/> prohibit creating PeerSession to unkown node
 - <csr-id-3d8070155bb88b7403ae97730b33510b8c3af685/> introducing Cmd::SendNodeMsgResponse for NodeMsg responses to nodes over streams
   - Having this internal sn_node::Cmd to handle sending msg responses to nodes over
   a response bi-stream allows us to decouple such logic from the rest, but it also
   allows us to have unit tests within sn_node which verify the outcome of processing
   Cmds without sending any msg over the wire.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-28cdebb4b05c5d64dcbe8dfb39a72c88fd2c28bd/> update comm members on AE msg in
 - <csr-id-0cbcc1dddf7db229b7fb81328108a076263343d2/> handle sending msgs off the incoming msg loop
   This should prevent us blocking qp2p should a channel itself be blocked

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9aaf91bfedd9fcf040f18e0762ff2cbbc03b4d6f/> forward client data cmds/queries to holders through Cmd::SendMsgAndAwaitResponse
   - Unifying and simplifying logic to send client data cmds and queries to holders so in both
   cases the sn_node `Cmd::SendMsgAndAwaitResponse` is used.
   - Renaming `sn_comms::Error::CmdSendError` to `SendError` since it's not specific for
   cmds but for any msg.
   - Some internal sn_node helper functions were moved to different files/mods so they are closer
   to the logic making use of them.
